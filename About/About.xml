	<description>"luciferium production"
	
	"These mechanoids could be the devil's spawn" - one colonist said and a crazy scientist started researching^^
	
	- adds a way to produce luciferium
	- needs research to build/produce/start, recipes need pawns with 10 crafting (extracting) and 7 medicine (medicine just for recipe on druglab)
	- how to get: kill mechs, get mech oil from them, distille it to raw luciferium batches, make luciferium with neutroamine at druglab
	- can build a stasis pod to extract mech oil
	- all stuff can be traded (exotic goods traders)
